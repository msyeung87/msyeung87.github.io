#MVP (Minimum viable Product)
This project was to create the popular casino game, blackjack where the player (YOU) are playing against the dealer through your internet browser.

#Rules and features
The main goal of this game is to get the total value of your cards to 21 and more than the dealer's card value. Place your bet and hit deal to receive your two cards. Dealer has 1 shown card and 1 hidden card. Add the value of your two cards and click hit if you want another card. Once satisfied with your total value of cards, hit stand for dealer's turn. See who's value is higher to evaluate the winner. But try not to bust by passing 21!
#Basic card rules
Ace = 1 or 11, 2 through 10 = face value, Jack/Queen/King = 10.
